Higher order functions
   functions that take or return other functions as arguments. Javascript. lambda in java8
   
When you say that a language has first-class functions, it means that the language treats functions as values â€“ that you can assign 
a function into a variable, pass it around etc. Higher-order functions are functions that work on other functions, meaning that they
take one or more functions as an argument and can also return a function.


Fisrt class functions versus higher oder functions
===================================================

First class functions

Values in a language that are handled uniformly throughout are called "first class". They may be stored in data structures, passed as
arguments, or used in control structures.

Languages which support values with function types, and treat them the same as non-function values, can be said to have
"first class functions".

Higher order functions

One of the consequences of having first class functions is that you should be able to pass a function as an argument to another function.
The latter function is now "higher order". It is a function that takes a function as an argumen
