A programming paradigm is a fundamental style of computer programming. There are four main paradigms: imperative, declarative, functional 
(which is considered a subset of the declarative paradigm) and object-oriented.

Declarative programming is a programming paradigm that expresses the logic of a computation(What do) without describing its
control flow(How do). Some well-known examples of declarative domain specific languages (DSLs) include CSS, regular expressions, and
a subset of SQL (SELECT queries, for example) Many markup languages such as HTML, MXML, XAML, XSLT... are often declarative. 
The declarative programming try to blur the distinction between a program as a set of instructions and a program as an assertion about
the desired answer.
